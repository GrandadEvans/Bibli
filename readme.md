# An Idea!

Ok, here's the deal. I have an idea for a new piece of software that 
could potentially make a lot of lives easier.

## So what is it?

Well as anybody who has had to write a bibliography will know it can be
a right royal pain in the arse at times.

What this will do is help to automate that. At first it will centered
around the Harvard system used by the Open University in the 
<abbr title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. That is because it is the body
that I am studying with.

## Wouldn't it be great&hellip;

Imagine that you copy and pasted a <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>
(web address) into your editor and it automatically went and retrieved the 
date the article was published, who published it and the title of the page?
All things that are needed for teh bibliography. Not only that it
automatically formats the bibliography entry and keeps track of it and
alters it accordingly.

## How and when can I use it

Well not yet, that's for certain. This project is partly a way for me to
play with new web technologies and I am learning the ins and out of some
good tools.

## Main tools used
* [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/)
* [Laravel]()
